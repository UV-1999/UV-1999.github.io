<h1 style="text-align: center;">My unwarranted notes on philosophy</h1>      
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p><strong>Philosophy</strong> - The study of reality (including agents) and the relationships of agents with reality.</p>
<p><strong>Reality</strong> - Everything (entities and properties).</p>
<p>
  <strong>Agent</strong> - Agents are entities that are able to experience reality and do reasoning.
  Reasoning is the process through which the agent forms beliefs.
  A belief is the attitude (perception) of an agent towards any entity or property.
  All philosophical inquiry is conducted by an agent.
</p>
<p><strong>Metaphysics</strong> - The study of reality.</p>
<p><strong>Logic</strong> - The formal language (communication and description) of philosophy.</p>    

<button id="collapsar" class="collapsible">Zero-order or Propositional Logic</button>
<div class="content">
<p>
  Propositions are beliefs expressed in some language.
  "True" and "False" are the two allowed logical values that a proposition can take.
  Propositions are either true or false, nowhere in between (Law of excluded middle).
</p>
<h3>Logical Connectives</h3>
<p>
  Logical connectives are fundamental operations that act on proposition(s) to develop compound propositions. They are:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Negation (not)</strong> - Every proposition has a corresponding negation (opposition).
  The negation of true is false and vice versa. if P is true then &not; P is false.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Disjunction (or)</strong> - Connects propositions with "or". (P &or; Q).
  True when at least one proposition is true. Disjunction is commutative and associative.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Conjunction (and)</strong> - Connects propositions with "and". (P &wedge; Q).
  True only if all propositions are true. Conjunction is commutative, associative and distributive over disjunction. 
</p>
<p>
  Once having determined the truth values of atomic propositions,
  the truth value of the compound proposition (propositions composed of some atomic propositions)
  can be determined using the definitions of the logical connectives.
  This process is called a <strong>logical proof</strong>.
  If a compound proposition that is always true regardless of the truth values of the atomic propositions it contains,
  is called a <strong>tautology</strong>.
  Similarly, a compound proposition that is always false is called a <strong>contradiction</strong>.
  A compound proposition that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is referred to as a <strong>contingency</strong>.
  The truth value of a contingent proposition hence depends on the atomic propositions.
</p>
<h3>De Morgan’s Laws</h3>
<p>
  <p><strong>First Law:</strong> &not; (P &wedge; Q) = &not;P &or; &not;Q
  <br>&not; (P &wedge; Q) is true when P or Q is false.
  <br>This means at least one of &not;P or &not;Q must be true.
  <br>Therefore, &not; (P &wedge; Q) = &not;P &or; &not;Q.
</p>

<p><strong>Second Law:</strong> &not; (P &or; Q) = &not;P &wedge; &not;Q
  <br>&not; (P &or; Q) is true when both P and Q are false.
  <br>This means both &not;P and &not;Q must be true.
  <br>Therefore, &not; (P &or; Q) = &not;P &wedge; &not;Q.
</p>

<h3>Implications</h3>
<p>
  For propositions A and B, if A implies B (A &rarr; B) then it means that if A is true, then B is true. Since either A can be true or false. “A &or; &not;A” is true.
  Which can be written as “B &or; &not;A”. Since A being false doesn't say anything about B. It may happen that despite A being false, B may be true.
  Falsity of antecedent (A) doesn't determine anything about consequence (B). This fact is commonly said as false implies anything (true or false).
  Also, true only implies true. E.g., If you kill a mosquito then it dies. Here A is “you kill a mosquito” and B is “it dies”.
  If you kill a mosquito, surely it dies, but if you don't kill a mosquito, then the mosquito may or may not die.
</p>
<p><strong>Biconditional Propositions:</strong> They are defined as "If P then Q, and If Q then P" or "P if Q, and Q if P" or P iff Q. (P &harr; Q) = ((P &rarr; Q) &wedge; (Q &rarr; P)).</p>
<p><strong>Inverse of Implication:</strong> (&not;P &rarr; &not;Q) = (P &or; &not;Q) = (&not;Q &or; P) = (Q &rarr; P) </p>
<p><strong>Biconditional Equivalence:</strong> (P = Q) = ((P &rarr; Q) &wedge; (&not;P &rarr; &not;Q)) = (P &harr; Q) </p>
  
<p><strong>Modus Ponens:</strong> ((P &rarr; Q) &wedge; P) &rarr; Q <br>
  ((P &rarr; Q) &wedge; P) = ((Q &or; &not;P) &wedge; P) <br>
  (((Q &or; &not;P) &wedge; P) &rarr; Q) = &not;((Q &or; &not;P) &wedge; P) &or; Q <br>
  From De Morgan's Law: <br>
  = &not;(Q &or; &not;P) &or; &not;P &or; Q <br>
  = &not;(Q &or; &not;P) &or; (Q &or; &not;P). This is a tautology.
</p>

<p><strong>Modus Tollens:</strong> ((P &rarr; Q) &wedge; &not;Q) &rarr; &not;P <br>
  ((P &rarr; Q) &wedge; &not;Q) = ((&not;P &or; Q) &wedge; &not;Q) <br>
  (((&not;P &or; Q) &wedge; &not;Q) &rarr; &not;P) = &not;((&not;P &or; Q) &wedge; &not;Q) &or; &not;P <br>
  From De Morgan's Law: <br>
  = &not;(&not;P &or; Q) &or; Q &or; &not;P <br>
  = &not;(&not;P &or; Q) &or; (&not;P &or; Q). This is a tautology.
</p>

<p><strong>Fallacy of Converse:</strong> (Q &wedge; (P &rarr; Q)) &rarr; P <br>
  (P &rarr; Q) = (&not;P &or; Q) <br>
  ((Q &wedge; (&not;P &or; Q)) &rarr; P) = &not;(Q &wedge; (&not;P &or; Q)) &or; P <br>
  From De Morgan's Law: <br>
  = &not;Q &or; &not;(&not;P &or; Q) &or; P <br>
  = &not;Q &or; (P &wedge; &not;Q) &or; P <br>
  = &not;Q &or; P &wedge; (&not;Q &or; True) <br>
  = &not;Q &or; P &wedge; &not;Q. <br>
  = &not;Q &wedge; (P &or; True) <br>
  = P &wedge; &not;Q <br>
  This is not a tautology.
</p>

<p><strong>Fallacy of Inverse:</strong> (&not;P &wedge; (P &rarr; Q)) &rarr; &not;Q <br>
  (P &rarr; Q) = (&not;P &or; Q) <br>
  ((&not;P &wedge; (&not;P &or; Q)) &rarr; &not;Q) = &not;(&not;P &wedge; (&not;P &or; Q)) &or; &not;Q <br>
  From De Morgan's Law: <br>
  = P &or; &not;(&not;P &or; Q) &or; &not;Q <br>
  = P &or; &not;Q &or; (P &wedge; &not;Q) <br>
  = P &or; &not;Q &wedge; (True &or; P) <br>
  = P &or; (&not;Q &wedge; P) <br>
  = P &wedge; (&not;Q &or; True) <br>
  = P &wedge; &not;Q <br>
  This is not a tautology.
</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Sufficient Conditions</strong> - P &rarr; Q (if P then Q). If P is true then Q is true. P is hence a sufficient condition for Q.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Necessary Conditions</strong> - P &rarr; Q (if P then Q) = &not;Q &rarr; &not;P.
      If Q is false then P is false.
      Q is hence a necessary condition for P.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    <strong>The conjunction of some necessary conditions is also a necessary condition:</strong>
    <br>
        ((P &rarr; A) &wedge; (P &rarr; B)) <br>
        = (A &or; &not;P) &wedge; (B &or; &not;P) <br>
        = (A &wedge; B) &or; (A &wedge; &not;P) &or; (B &wedge; &not;P) &or; (&not;P) <br>
        = (A &wedge; B) &or; (&not;A &or; P) &or; (&not;B &or; &not;P) &or; (&not;P) <br>
        = (A &wedge; B) &or; (&not;P) = P &rarr; (A &wedge; B)
    </p>

  <h3>Self-Referential Statements</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Self-affirming statements</strong> - Consider “this statement is true.”
      This statement is meaningless since if it is true, then it is true, or if it is false, then it is false.
      The implication is true (valid) but the statement is meaningless since we know that for any A, A &rarr;
      A is always true irrespective of the truth value of A.
      But a self-affirming statement can be either true or false, hence is not a proposition.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Self-negating statements</strong> - Consider “this statement is false.”
      This statement is also meaningless since if it is true, then it is false, or if it is false, then it is true.
      The implication is contingent on the truth value of the statement.
      The self-negating statements are neither true nor false, hence are not propositions.
    </p>
</div>

<button id="collapsar" class="collapsible">First-order Logic</button>
<div class="content">
<p>Consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If Paris is in France then French people are from France (true implies true).</li>
        <li>If Paris is in England then English people are from France (false implies false).</li>
        <li>If Paris is in England then French people are from France (false implies true).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The problem here is that the implications are irrelevant. True implies true, but there is no connection between antecedent and consequent.
    </p>
    <p>
        First-order logic solves the above problem by allowing for the formalization of statements about entities and their properties.
        A proposition is resolved into a subject (description of entities) and predicates (description of properties).
        A predicate is a part of propositions that talks about a property of some variable (an instance of the subject).
        The meaning of a predicate is exactly a function from the domain of variables to the truth-values “true” and “false”.
        A domain is the set of all variables for which the property is defined. A domain is necessary to determine the truth value of any predicate.
        A property is not defined for variables outside its domain.
    </p>
    <p>
        In checking the consistency and causal relevance of implications, first-order logic uses quantification.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Quantification</strong> - This ensures that statements apply either universally or exist under certain conditions.
      For instance, in an implication P(x) &rarr; Q(x), first-order logic requires that there be a consistent domain of discourse.
      The predicates P and Q must involve entities within the same domain (i.e., x should refer to the same entity in both cases).
    </p>

    
    <p>
      <strong>Quantifiers</strong> - Quantifiers tell you for how many elements in a collection (that take place as variables)
      the given predicate is true or false.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Universal quantifier</strong> - “for all” (∀) - True when predicate is true for all variables. <br>
      ∀x(P(x)) = P(x<sub>1</sub>) &wedge; P(x<sub>2</sub>) &wedge; P(x<sub>1</sub>) &wedge; ...
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong>Existential quantifier</strong> - “there exists” (∃) - True when predicate is true for at least one variable. <br>
       ∃x(P(x)) = P(x<sub>1</sub>) &or; P(x<sub>2</sub>) &or; P(x<sub>1</sub>) &or; ...
    </p>
    <p>
      From De Morgan’s Laws:
      <br>&sim;∃x(P(x)) = ∀x(&sim;P(x))
      <br>&sim;∀x(P(x)) = ∃x(&sim;P(x))
   </p>

    <p>
        If a property P is true for all x, then P is an identity of x.
        If an identity exists, then it is necessary for all x but it is not sufficient.
        Being a mammal is an identity of cats. Cats are necessarily mammals, but that's not the sufficient condition to be a cat.
    </p>

    <h3>An example of first-order proof</h3>
    <p>Proof that if a proposition p has a finite number of necessary conditions, then the conjunction of those necessary conditions is sufficient for p:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Consider a and b to be necessary conditions for p. &nbsp; [ (p &rarr; a) &wedge; (p &rarr; b) ]</li>
        <li>Consider no other proposition c that is necessary for p. &nbsp; [ &not;∃c(p &rarr; c) ]</li>
        <li>
            Then let us assume that a and b are true but p is false. (p &rarr; a) &wedge; (p &rarr; b) is True. (false can imply true). It means that even if a and b are true, p can be false since they are not sufficient.
        </li>
        <li>
            If p is false and c is false, then p &rarr; c holds true. This should not be the case.
        </li>
        <li>
            If p is false and c is true, then again p &rarr; c holds true. This should not be the case.
        </li>
        <li>
            If p is true and c is true, then again p &rarr; c holds true. This should not be the case.
        </li>
        <li>
            If p is true and c is false, then only p &rarr; c holds false. Which is the condition (2).
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        So with condition (2), p is true while a and b are true, so a and b together is a sufficient condition for p.
    </p>

    <p>
        ((p &rarr; a) &wedge; (p &rarr; b) &wedge; &not;∃c(p &rarr; c)) &rarr; ((a &wedge; b) &harr; p)
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Arguments</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Deductive</strong> - Special conclusion from general rule. As long as the general rule is true, a valid special conclusion is also true; hence the deduction is sound. 
            <br>
            ∀x(P(x)) &rarr; ∃x(P(x))
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Inductive</strong> - Probable general conclusion from special observation. 
            <br>
            ∃x(P(x)) &rarr; ∀x(P(x))
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Abductive</strong> - Probable cause of conclusion from a general rule (making the most likely explanation based on evidence). 
            <br>
            (p &rarr; q) &wedge; q &rarr; p
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The idea of non-deductive arguments introduces the concept of probability.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only deductive reasoning guarantees the truth of the conclusion. Abductive and inductive reasoning are trial fits to make the deduction work.
    </p>

    <p>
        In abduction, we seek a probable case that makes the conclusion deductively true given the rule is true. In induction, we seek a probable rule that makes the conclusion deductively true given the case is true. In a way, abduction is about finding what probably happened, and induction is about what probably will happen. Deduction is finding what happens.
    </p>

    <p>
        Proof by induction has no induction in it. The inductive hypothesis "p(x<sub>0</sub>)" and the inductive step "p(x<sub>k</sub>) &rarr; p(x<sub>k+1</sub>)" are proven, and then by repeated modus ponens, p(x) is proven for all x. It is all deductive.
    </p>

    <h3>Münchhausen Trilemma</h3>
    <p>There are only three ways of completing an argument:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>The circular argument</strong>, in which the proof of some proposition presupposes the truth of that very proposition.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The regressive argument</strong>, in which each proof requires a further proof, ad infinitum.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The dogmatic argument</strong>, which rests on accepted precepts that are merely asserted rather than defended.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The trilemma, then, is the decision among the three equally unsatisfying options.
      Karl Popper’s suggestion was to accept the trilemma as unsolvable and work with knowledge by way of conjecture and criticism.
      This is the essence of science. We do not seek the “ultimate truths” but rather we approximate reality for our uses.
      If we find errors, we jump to a new, better approximation.
    </p>

  <p> The goal of science is to create a description of the system (The part of reality you are interested in studying) by
establishing relations among the properties of the system by knowing all of its properties.
At any instant such a description is called a theory.
The theory does not exactly describe the system but a model of the system which is an approximation of it.
Every observation of a system may give us knowledge of some properties of the system.
The model has to be developed such that it explains all the known properties.
But such a model is not complete; it has to predict new properties.
If such predictions are observed then such observations become evidence for the theory.
If observations are contrary to the predictions then the theory is revised or discarded.
This process has to be repeated and be called science.

<button id="collapsar" class="collapsible">Analytic-Synthetic Distinction</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>In first order logic, atomic propositions are descriptions of some entity and its properties.
An atomic proposition is true if it corresponds to reality or is coherent with other truths or definitions. There are two types of atomic propositions:</p>

    <h2>1. Analytic</h2>
    <p>Since the subject is the description of an entity,
it requires some sufficient properties that hold for the entity to be labelled as the subject.
If there exists an x such that (all definitive properties are true for x), then x is labelled as whatever it is called.
They do not necessarily conform to reality but are true because the definitive properties must not contradict each other (coherent truth).
The predicate is hence the definition of the subject. So these propositions are true because of coherence. They are definitive statements.
They are a priori as they do not require empirical evidence. They are contingent but only on the consistency of the definitive properties.</p>
    
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>“A quadrilateral has four sides.” (Quadrilaterals are defined as planar shapes which have four sides.)</li>
        <li>“A sister is a female sibling.” (“Female siblings” and “sisters” are literally the same thing.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. Synthetic</h2>
    <p>The predicate is not the definition of the subject, where properties other than definitive properties are claimed.
They are contingent either on reason or observation:</p>
    
    <h3>2.1. A-posteriori Synthetic</h3>
    <p>Without using any sensory information or inferential experiment, the truth value of these claims cannot be decided.
Observation is sufficient to be true. If definitive properties are consistent with the synthetic properties, then it is possible to be true.
So looking for observations is motivated.
If definitive properties are inconsistent with synthetic properties, then it is impossible to be true, hence false.</p>
    
    <p>So synthetic a-posteriori truths are true by only observation (empirical truths) and false by only inconsistency.
Hence the truth value is contingent both on correspondence and coherence.</p>
    
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>“It is raining.” - To be true, one must observe rain directly, but to be always false,
the definition (cloud pouring water on the ground in a certain region) must be inconsistent with the synthetic claim which is “happening”.
One of the definitive properties required to identify rain is clouds; if we observe the sky to be clear,
we can then claim that “it is raining” is false without observing rain.</li>
        <li>“Water is H2O.” - Water is defined as a transparent liquid inorganic substance that humans can drink,
but to claim that it is H2O chemically requires evidence to be true. However,
to be false, water is defined to have properties that are inconsistent with the claim of being H2O.</li>
        <li>“Pigs can fly.” - The definition of pigs and the property of being able to fly are inconsistent,
so without observing all the pigs, we can know that there are no pigs that can fly.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Now consider "There is a hippopotamus in this matchbox." I can try to observe but cannot find it,
and then it can be argued that it is actually hidden maybe, because not observing the hippos does not make the claim false.
But one can take the definition of a hippopotamus and a matchbox and analyze that it is bigger than a matchbox,
so it cannot be in this matchbox. So here, without observing a hippo, we can say that the claim is false. In a way,
we claimed that “A hippo cannot be in a matchbox” to be true, which is synthetic but not a posteriori.</p>

    <h3>2.2. A-priori Synthetic</h3>
    <p>No need for direct experience or observation to be true. Example: “For a triangle, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees.”
This is not the definition of a triangle but still is true without any direct observation. However,
it is impossible to prove the angle sum property of triangles without having the notion of space. To define something,
all sufficient properties must be met. After that, one can find necessary properties.
Reason is needed but also some sufficient background experience (conceptual) and definitions.</p>
    
    <p>Consider “ought implies can.” It is not analytic and not a posteriori (though it can be verified),
but to be true, it requires reason alone starting from the definitions. Ought to do something is a property of actions that are moral.
If someone cannot do an action, then the action is not there, hence cannot be judged for its morality.</p>
    
    <p>Now consider that all synthetic a priori claims are true in their conceptual framework,
so the cases where the conceptual framework does not work, the synthetic a priori claims do not work either.
For example, the angle sum property is true for triangles in Euclidean geometry only.
Hence, a priori synthetic claims are true only coherently.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Synthetic a priori claims are not metaphysical truths (opposed to what Kant argued) because their truth is contingent upon the conceptual framework
(e.g., Euclidean geometry or classical mechanics) in which they operate. They are coherent within these frameworks (models of reality or definitions of concepts)
but not necessarily true of reality in an absolute metaphysical sense.</p>
    
    <p>Synthetic a posteriori claims, as emphasized by Hume, are based on empirical observation and inductive reasoning,
which makes them contingent truths about the physical world. Since they depend on observation and could be otherwise,
they are not truly metaphysical in the sense of being necessary truths about reality.
Instead, they describe the physical world rather than the metaphysical foundations of reality.</p>
    
    <p>Metaphysical truths are hence the limit of synthetic a priori truths when they are immune to revision,
as the definition on which synthetic a priori truths are contingent, is themselves contingent on how agents observe reality.
Metaphysical truths are necessary for experience to be possible, but to reach them one has to observe reality and revise the analytic truths.
So we can come up with metaphysical truths abductively and then only test them.
This is why metaphysics is “analysis” of reality since we set up analytic claims and derive synthetic
a priori claims from them and test them like synthetic a posteriori.

  <p><strong>Epistemology</strong> - The study of how agents interact with reality, theoretically. It is the study of how the agent knows the reality.
It is the analysis of knowledge. Knowledge is justified true beliefs without luck. Hence, knowledge is proven true belief.
Proof is a stricter standard than justification, which eliminates the problem of epistemic luck by empirical demonstration.
JTB (justified true belief) should be formally regarded as informed guesswork.</p>
  
    <p><strong>Ethics</strong> - The study of how agents interact with reality, practically. Ethics only applies to moral agents.
Moral agents are agents that can make choices. Hence, ethics becomes the study of an agent’s choices.
In ethics, the goal is to find the right choices. This defines what the agent ought to do. But ought implies can.
Ethics presumes the concepts of free will (for choices) and harm (for morally right choices).
Kant said "Ought implies can," but what implies ought? Is it consequences or intentions? And what one is ought to do?</p>
