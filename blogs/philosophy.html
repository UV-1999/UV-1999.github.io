<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
Philosophy is the generalised study of any thing. Entities are things that exists. Entities can also be called "real things".
To exist is to be the part of reality. Reality is the totatlity of entities and their descriptions.
The study of reality (to find what things are entities and what is their description) is called metaphysics.
</p>
<p>
Agents are entities that are able to experience reality and do reasoning. You are an agent. Objects are entities other than agents.
A chair is an object. Some things are not existent in reality as entities but still they can be described. For example, spiderman, electric fields, a line, etc.
These things do not exists as entities but rather "exists" (in loose sense) only as ideas or concepts. Concepts or ideas are also things but not real.
Properties are the descriptions of things. and things are the subject of beliefs.
A belief is the attitude (judgement) held by an agent about any description of properties of a thing.
Experience and reasoning are the processes through which an agent forms beliefs.
A belief expressed in some formal language is called a proposition.

    <p>
      <strong>Ethics</strong> - Moral agents are agents that can make choices. Ethics is the study of an agentâ€™s choices.
      In ethics, the goal is to find the right choices (what an agent is ought to do - moral principles).
      Moral choices can only be made when the agent is able to make choice which Kant described as "Ought implies can," but what implies ought?
      Is it consequences or intentions?
