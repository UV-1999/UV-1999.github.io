<p>In first order logic, atomic propositions are descriptions of some entity and its properties.
An atomic proposition is true if it corresponds to reality or is coherent with other truths or definitions. There are two types of atomic propositions:</p>

    <h2>1. Analytic</h2>
    <p>Since the subject is the description of an entity,
it requires some sufficient properties that hold for the entity to be labelled as the subject.
If there exists an x such that (all definitive properties are true for x), then x is labelled as whatever it is called.
They do not necessarily conform to reality but are true because the definitive properties must not contradict each other (coherent truth).
The predicate is hence the definition of the subject. So these propositions are true because of coherence. They are definitive statements.
They are a priori as they do not require empirical evidence. They are contingent but only on the consistency of the definitive properties.</p>
    
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>“A quadrilateral has four sides.” (Quadrilaterals are defined as planar shapes which have four sides.)</li>
        <li>“A sister is a female sibling.” (“Female siblings” and “sisters” are literally the same thing.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. Synthetic</h2>
    <p>The predicate is not the definition of the subject, where properties other than definitive properties are claimed.
They are contingent either on reason or observation:</p>
    
    <h3>2.1. A-posteriori Synthetic</h3>
    <p>Without using any sensory information or inferential experiment, the truth value of these claims cannot be decided.
Observation is sufficient to be true. If definitive properties are consistent with the synthetic properties, then it is possible to be true.
So looking for observations is motivated.
If definitive properties are inconsistent with synthetic properties, then it is impossible to be true, hence false.</p>
    
    <p>So synthetic a-posteriori truths are true by only observation (empirical truths) and false by only inconsistency.
Hence the truth value is contingent both on correspondence and coherence.</p>
    
    <p>Examples:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>“It is raining.” - To be true, one must observe rain directly, but to be always false,
the definition (cloud pouring water on the ground in a certain region) must be inconsistent with the synthetic claim which is “happening”.
One of the definitive properties required to identify rain is clouds; if we observe the sky to be clear,
we can then claim that “it is raining” is false without observing rain.</li>
        <li>“Water is H2O.” - Water is defined as a transparent liquid inorganic substance that humans can drink,
but to claim that it is H2O chemically requires evidence to be true. However,
to be false, water is defined to have properties that are inconsistent with the claim of being H2O.</li>
        <li>“Pigs can fly.” - The definition of pigs and the property of being able to fly are inconsistent,
so without observing all the pigs, we can know that there are no pigs that can fly.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Now consider "There is a hippopotamus in this matchbox." I can try to observe but cannot find it,
and then it can be argued that it is actually hidden maybe, because not observing the hippos does not make the claim false.
But one can take the definition of a hippopotamus and a matchbox and analyze that it is bigger than a matchbox,
so it cannot be in this matchbox. So here, without observing a hippo, we can say that the claim is false. In a way,
we claimed that “A hippo cannot be in a matchbox” to be true, which is synthetic but not a posteriori.</p>

    <h3>2.2. A-priori Synthetic</h3>
    <p>No need for direct experience or observation to be true. Example: “For a triangle, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees.”
This is not the definition of a triangle but still is true without any direct observation. However,
it is impossible to prove the angle sum property of triangles without having the notion of space. To define something,
all sufficient properties must be met. After that, one can find necessary properties.
Reason is needed but also some sufficient background experience (conceptual) and definitions.</p>
    
    <p>Consider “ought implies can.” It is not analytic and not a posteriori (though it can be verified),
but to be true, it requires reason alone starting from the definitions. Ought to do something is a property of actions that are moral.
If someone cannot do an action, then the action is not there, hence cannot be judged for its morality.</p>
    
    <p>Now consider that all synthetic a priori claims are true in their conceptual framework,
so the cases where the conceptual framework does not work, the synthetic a priori claims do not work either.
For example, the angle sum property is true for triangles in Euclidean geometry only.
Hence, a priori synthetic claims are true only coherently.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Synthetic a priori claims are not metaphysical truths (opposed to what Kant argued) because their truth is contingent upon the conceptual framework
(e.g., Euclidean geometry or classical mechanics) in which they operate. They are coherent within these frameworks (models of reality or definitions of concepts)
but not necessarily true of reality in an absolute metaphysical sense.</p>
    
    <p>Synthetic a posteriori claims, as emphasized by Hume, are based on empirical observation and inductive reasoning,
which makes them contingent truths about the physical world. Since they depend on observation and could be otherwise,
they are not truly metaphysical in the sense of being necessary truths about reality.
Instead, they describe the physical world rather than the metaphysical foundations of reality.</p>
    
    <p>Metaphysical truths are hence the limit of synthetic a priori truths when they are immune to revision,
as the definition on which synthetic a priori truths are contingent, is themselves contingent on how agents observe reality.
Metaphysical truths are necessary for experience to be possible, but to reach them one has to observe reality and revise the analytic truths.
So we can come up with metaphysical truths abductively and then only test them.
This is why metaphysics is “analysis” of reality since we set up analytic claims and derive synthetic a priori claims from them and test them like synthetic a posteriori.</p>
