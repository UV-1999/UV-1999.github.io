<h1 style="text-align: center;">My unwarranted notes on philosophy</h1>      
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>
Philosophy is the generalised study of any thing. Things are of two kinds: Real things and abstract things. Real things are also termed as entities.
Entities are things that exists. To exist is to be the part of reality. Reality is the totatlity of entities and their descriptions.
</p>
<p>
The study of reality (to find what things are entities and what is their description) is called metaphysics.
Metaphysics is often regarded as the first philosophy.
</p>
<p>
Agents are entities that are able to experience reality and do reasoning. You are an agent. Objects are entities other than agents. A chair is an object. 
</p>
<p>
Abstract things are not existent in reality as entities but still they can be conceived and described by agents.
For example, spiderman, electric fields, point particles, line, etc.
</p>
<p>
Properties are the descriptions of things. Experience and reasoning are the processes through which an agent forms beliefs.
A belief is the attitude (judgement) held by an agent about any description of properties of a thing. 
A belief expressed in some language is called a proposition.
</p>
<p>
A proposition is qualifiied as true and be called a truth if it corresponds to reality (the correspondence theory of truth) or
is reasoned based on other truths or definitions (the coherence theory of truth).
Reasoning is the act of forming proposition from other propositions.
The initial propositions from where reasoning starts are called premises and the inferred propositions are called conclusions.
The premises proposed to derive some conclusions from it is called an argument.

<strong>Deductive</strong> - Special conclusion from general rule. As long as the general rule is true.<br>
A non-deductive or ampliative argument is of two types:<br>
<strong>Inductive</strong> - Probable general conclusion from special observation.<br>
<strong>Abductive</strong> - Probable cause of conclusion from a general rule (making the most likely explanation based on evidence).

    <p>
      Only deductive reasoning guarantees the truth of the conclusion.
      Abductive and inductive reasoning are trial fits to make the deduction work.
      The idea of non-deductive arguments introduces the concept of probability.<br>
      In abduction, we seek a probable case that makes the conclusion deductively true given the rule is true.<br>
      In induction, we seek a probable rule that makes the conclusion deductively true given the case is true.<br>
      In a way, abduction is about finding what probably happened, and induction is about what probably will happen.
      Deduction is finding what happens.

    <p><strong>Münchhausen Trilemma</strong></p><br>
    <p>There are only three ways of completing an argument:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>The circular argument</strong>, in which the proof of some proposition presupposes the truth of that very proposition.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The regressive argument</strong>, in which each proof requires a further proof, ad infinitum.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>The dogmatic argument</strong>, which rests on accepted precepts that are merely asserted rather than defended.
        </li>
    </ol>
<p>
The trilemma, then, is the decision among the three equally unsatisfying options.
Karl Popper’s suggestion was to accept the trilemma as unsolvable and work with knowledge by way of conjecture and criticism.

      <strong>Ethics</strong> - Moral agents are agents that can make choices. Ethics is the study of an agent’s choices.
      In ethics, the goal is to find the right choices (what an agent is ought to do - moral principles).
      Moral choices can only be made when the agent is able to make choice which Kant described as "Ought implies can," but what implies ought?
      Is it consequences or intentions?
