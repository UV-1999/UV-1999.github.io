# Philosophy
My unwarranted notes on whatever I write here.

> “Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly; Man got to sit and wonder 'why, why, why?'
> Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land; Man got to tell himself he understand.”

Philosophy is the pursuit of **wisdom**. Wisdom is **knowledge** applied to make **good** judgements.
Judgements or decisions are the **beliefs** (a collection of thoughts) that motivate certain actions.
This forces us to ask what is knowledge and what is good? And several more questions.

[What are thoughts?]

## Epistemology - Nature of Truth

Knowledge is a truth that is also properly justified. Gettier problem?
The solution to Gettier cases is in accepting that the justification is limited to contingency and probability.

Information is the pattern or the lack of randomness in data.
One can say that the extent to which data is informative to someone depends on the extent to which it is unexpected by that person.
More unexpected, more information in data. The amount of information contained in a data stream can be characterized by its Shannon entropy.

### What is Data?
Thoughts obtained/recorded through experience/experiments are data.

Truths are propositions that are true. [What is true?]

Epistemology is the study of the nature of truth.

Propositions are beliefs represented through some language as sentences that are not vague or ambiguous.

**Ambiguity** is about a word having several meanings. Context or definition is needed to avoid ambiguity. For example, a plane (aircraft or surface).

**Vagueness** is about words that describe some quantity but are not at all precise, like large and small. To avoid vagueness, we use numbers or give comparative statements.

### When is a Proposition True?

**Analytically - True by Reasoning**

A proposition such as "If p and q, then p" is considered to be an analytic truth because of the meaning of the symbols and words in it and not because of any fact of any particular world.
They are such that they could not be untrue. Analytic truth (also called a necessary truth) is a proposition that is true in all possible worlds or under all possible interpretations.

**Factually - True by Reality**

Factually true propositions are called synthetic truths or facts. A fact (also called a contingency), is only true in this world as it has historically unfolded.
It is a proposition that is true by conforming to reality.
