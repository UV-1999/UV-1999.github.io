# Philosophy
My unwarranted notes on whatever I write here.

> “Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly; Man got to sit and wonder 'why, why, why?'
> Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land; Man got to tell himself he understand.”

Philosophy is the pursuit of **wisdom**. Wisdom is **knowledge** applied to make **good** judgements.
Judgements or decisions are the **beliefs** that motivate certain actions.
This forces us to ask what is knowledge? what are beliefs? and what is good? And several more questions.

## Major branches of Philosophy:
### [Epistemology - study of nature of Truth](https://uv-1999.github.io/notes/epistemology)
### [Logic - study of nature of reason](https://uv-1999.github.io/notes/logic)
### [Metaphysics- study of nature of reality](https://uv-1999.github.io/notes/metaphysics)
### [Axiology - study of nature of value](https://uv-1999.github.io/notes/axiology)
