# Philosophy
My unwarranted notes on whatever I write here.

> “Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly; Man got to sit and wonder 'why, why, why?'
> Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land; Man got to tell himself he understand.”

Philosophy is the pursuit of **wisdom**. Wisdom is **knowledge** applied to make **good** judgements.
Judgements or decisions are the **beliefs** that motivate certain actions.
This forces us to ask what is knowledge? what are beliefs? and what is good? And several more questions.
