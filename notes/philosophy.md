# From Philosophy to Science to Physics
My unwarranted notes on whatever I write here.

> “Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly; Man got to sit and wonder 'why, why, why?' <br>
> Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land; Man got to tell himself he understand.”

Philosophy is the pursuit of **wisdom**. Wisdom is **knowledge** applied to make **good** judgements.
Judgements are the **beliefs** that motivate certain actions.

## Major branches of Philosophy:
### 1. Epistemology - What is the nature of truth?
### 2. [Logic - What is the nature of reason?](https://uv-1999.github.io/notes/logic)
### 3. Metaphysics- What is the nature of reality?
### 4. Axiology - What is the nature of values?
### 5. Maybe more since one can always philosophise...

### [Science]([#science](https://uv-1999.github.io/notes/science))
### 1. [Classical Physics](https://uv-1999.github.io/notes/physics/classical)
### 2. [Quantum Physics](https://uv-1999.github.io/notes/physics/quantum)
### 3. [Thermal Physics](https://uv-1999.github.io/notes/physics/thermal)
### 4. [Solid State Physics](https://uv-1999.github.io/notes/physics/solid)
### 5. [Atomic and Molecular Physics](https://uv-1999.github.io/notes/physics/amol)
### 6. [Nuclear Physics](https://uv-1999.github.io/notes/physics/nuclear)
### 7. [Particle Physics](https://uv-1999.github.io/notes/physics/particle)
