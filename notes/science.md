# Science

## TYPES OF SCIENCES
### FORMAL SCIENCE
Useful mental constructs: logic, mathematics and computer science, etc.
### EMPIRICAL/NATURAL SCIENCE
Explaining the observations. Includes Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Social Science includes humanities, history, psychology. Scientific Method is used.

## SCIENTIFIC METHOD

Observation is there → Abductive reasoning is done to reach a hypothesis.

Phenomenology - extracting meaningful insights from empirical data and often serves as a precursor to theoretical developments.

Hypothesis predicts something by deductive reasoning → Prediction is tested by experiment.

An experiment is designed either to demonstrate the observations or to check the predictions.

If prediction is experimentally verified to be true then the hypothesis becomes theory, by inductive reasoning it is taken as part of scientific knowledge.

If prediction comes out to be false then the theory is discarded or labelled as of limited validity.

Every theory is tested repeatedly to avoid mistakes. If new observations violate the theory then again the theory becomes limited or even discarded when better theory is there. The description provided by theory became more concise as unnecessary details were removed, and they became more precise as the level of detail was increased but It became accurate only by the experimental verification of it.

Theory = Laws + Model
Model = A description of a system using assumptions and approximations, introduces physical quantities.
Laws = Mathematical statements that are derived from experimental results relating physical quantities.

All laws are just postulates. Every law is a postulate, that is true only by support of experiments. Science can only answer the "how" questions. It cannot answer "why" questions. One can only find some set of postulates, rather be scalar or vector relations or a differential equation of anything from which one can finally derive the behaviour of a system. There are no proofs in theoretical physics, just some statements that can be written mathematically, only some results are derivable from those postulates. Science is finding a better description of nature. Better means that experimentally conforms with nature. In science, we don't care about its interpretation, or its intuition. We just want to make sure that it works. The why questions are not left in the corner, but they are handled in metaphysics.

### Kuhn’s phases of science:
1. Pre Paradigmatic science (e.g. physics before Newton)
2. Normal Science (e.g. classical mechanics)
3. Crisis (e.g. UV catastrophe)
4. Scientific revolution (e.g. Relativity and QM)

You go from 1 to 2 to 3 to either return to 2 or to go to 4 to again create a new paradigm and call it new normal science.

### Characteristics of a scientific theory:

1. Popper’s rule: A theory must be testable, refutable and falsifiable.

2. Hitchens's razor: What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.

3. Occam's razor: Given two competing theories which in all tested cases produce Identical results, The theory that makes fewer assumptions is preferred.
Better theories may be regarded as generalisation of limited theories. Different strong theories are tried to be logically consistent with each other to form a singular theory ultimately (unification).

5. Reality of a theory: a necessary ingredient of a theory that correctly describes what we observe is called Real observable or a 'real' thing. Electrons and other elementary particles are a great example, we don’t interact with those things on the size scales of our routine human life but the observations support their existence, because after all they are just an idea inherently.

A classic example is the theory of general relativity. One of the logical consequences of its hypotheses is that light will be affected by the gravity of a massive body. That is: If (1) the theory of general relativity is true, then (2) light will be affected by the gravity of a massive body. Now the truth of (2) will not logically imply the truth of (1). However, the falsity of (2) will imply the falsity of (1): i.e. if (2) turns out to be false, then there will have to be a false hypothesis somewhere in the theory of general relativity. It turns out that the truth of (2) can be tested by observation.

In the famous eclipse experiment of 1919, the positions of stars near the sun were carefully measured while the sun was eclipsed by the moon. Those measurements were compared with the positions of those same stars when the sun was in another part of the sky. And it was found that their positions had changed: the gravitational field of the sun had deflected the light from the stars. In other words, the theory of general relativity predicted that light will be affected by gravity. And if that prediction had been proven false, that would have meant that the theory could not have been completely true. However, proving the truth of the prediction was not enough by itself to prove the truth of the theory.

That’s why theories are tested as much as possible by logically deriving many different predictions from them, and then using observation or experiment to determine whether those predictions are true. A single failed prediction would be enough to prove the theory false. Therefore, the more true predictions the theory produces, the more likely it is that the theory itself is true. So that is the primary way that empirical sciences are based on logic. They use the laws of logical deduction (which include mathematics) to generate predictions, based on the hypotheses of their theories. It’s then up to the observers and experimentalists to determine whether those predictions are true.
