## Metaphysics

How real (factually true) a proposition is, that is dealt in metaphysics.

You can’t make true statements about the world without input from the world. Eratosthenes didn’t really measure the Earth for its circumference, not even though he knew it as self-evident. He INFERRED it from the facts of shadows and geometry.

Ontology is a branch of metaphysics studying existence in reality.

**Ontological parasite**
Their existence depends fully on the existence of others, e.g. holes, point, line and plane. Properties of existing objects are the trivial case of ontological parasites.

**Ontological Reductionism**
Thought experiment: INCARS - A INCAR is a car that is in the garage. If any car is in the garage then INCAR exists. When a car leaves, the INCAR diminishes into non-existence and can be again created when a car gets in the garage. So are INCARS real? Trivially it is a made-up thing because we can reduce its existence by saying that only cars exist and being in a garage is just a property of that car. Thus ontological reductionism helps us to identify the simplest of a composition and to understand which thing actually exists or not, depending on their properties. As more and more properties are known, more fundamental-er simples are discovered and more bigger and complex compositions can be understood.

**Identical**
All the properties must be exactly equal then only two things are identical.

**Wrong Theorem** 
A cat has nine tails. 

**Wrong Proof**
No cat has eight tails. A cat has one more tail than no cat. Therefore a cat has nine tails. 
BUT. No cat has actually any number of tails The number of tails no cat has is indeterminate hence proof is wrong. Non-existent things have indeterminate properties.

SCIENCE is a branch of METAPHYSICS that aims to find the facts of nature using experiments based on logical empiricism.
