### Particle rays

- **Alpha rays**: Composed of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, heavy with thick, short tracks, and least penetrating.
- **Beta rays**: High-energy electrons, with long and chaotic tracks.
- **Gamma rays**: Photons, highly penetrating.
- **Delta rays**: Electrons ejected from a medium by high-energy cosmic rays.
- **Cosmic rays**: Primarily protons and muons, with pions and kaons formed in the upper atmosphere.

Since neutrons and protons have very similar masses but differ only by the amount of charge while being commonly found in atomic nuclei. It was suspected that they both might be two different manifestations of some fundamental entity. This was also observed with other hadrons.

### Additional Points
- Hadrons participate only in strong and electromagnetic interactions.
- The pion is the exchange particle for strong interactions between hadrons.
- Strong interaction strength increases with distance for quarks but decreases for hadrons, making it short-ranged for hadrons.
- Free neutrons decay, while free protons do not.
- The presence of neutrinos in a reaction implies weak interaction.
- Parity is not conserved in weak interactions.

### Resonance Particles
Resonance particles are short-lived excited states of particles, such as:
- **Rho particle**: An excited state of pions.
- **Delta particle**: An excited state of protons.


## Particle Interaction Diagrams
Particle interaction diagrams (Feynman diagrams)illustrate the interactions between particles at a vertex, representing a singular point in spacetime where the interactions occur. Each vertex corresponds to a coupling constant, indicating the strength of the interaction. The lines in the diagrams represent the particles, but not their physical trajectories.

The transition rate $$R$$ for a decay or interaction is proportional to the square of the coupling constant $$g$$ and the density of states factor $$\rho(E)$$:

$$R = K \cdot g^2 \cdot \rho(E)$$

where $$K$$ is a constant.

The transition rate $$R$$ measures the probability per unit time for the interaction to occur.

For particle decays, $$R \propto \frac{1}{T}$$, where $$T$$ is the lifetime of the particle. The density of states $$\rho$$ indicates the number of quantum states available per unit energy range for the final products, influencing the transition rate. The sqaure of the coupling constant $$g^2$$ reflects the intrinsic rate of the interaction.

In a decay process, the only stable particles are the photon, electron, both electron and muon neutrinos, and the proton. For specific decays, other factors, such as mass, can influence the particle's lifetime. Stronger interactions tend to dominate weaker ones, meaning particles often decay via the fastest available route.
