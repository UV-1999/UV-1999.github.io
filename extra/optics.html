          <strong>STAGE 1 - The light detector (specific intensity detector) (photosensitivity)</strong><br>
          Think of an organism that has eyes without a lens, just some small hole in the head that detects light Only if the light hits perpendicular to that hole surface. Then only, the creature will see something, and that vision would be of light which is the same everywhere in the field of view but as soon as the creature tilts the head, it again becomes dark for them. These eyes are useless, they just tell you if there is any light coming directly perpendicular or not.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <strong>STAGE 2 - The light detector with some solid angle (specific flux detector) (lens for FOV)<br></strong>
          Think of some evolution, now the creature has a big retina (has to be concave in shape) so now light coming from any direction (or at least some solid angle) is the new FOV of the creature, so even the creature tilts its head, the light detection will go on, only when the creature tilts the head such that the direction from which the light is coming is out of FOV then the creature see again dark This dark sensation is called Eigengrau, but this evolution also has a problem, the creature can't decide from exactly what direction the light is coming from.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <strong>STAGE 3 - The light detector with solid angle and a frequency range (flux detector) (Colors)<br></strong>
          Till now there is no information in the vision other than light (of some colour) and darkness, same in the whole FOV. Now more evolution is needed, light is reflected off of surfaces, whatever frequencies or wavelength of light is reflected becomes the colour of the object but the sensibility or detectivity depends heavily on the eyes, the eye now needs special cells to detect specific range of frequencies or wavelengths.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
          <strong>STAGE 4 - The light detector with solid angle, frequency range. And area (Luminosity detector with imaging) (resolution)<br></strong>
          If eyes can develop a lens (a convex one, converging lens) then light falling somewhere away to the retina can be focused to gather more information, more rays (at different angles) gathered and lesser will be blurry vision that was previously there, now from a single coloured view, eyes can see objects and differentiate between them. The vision is clear, dependent on the size of the lens, and the angular extent of the retina and the cells that detect light and its wavelength or frequency. So we need intersections to form an image of an extended source of light so that the rays meet at a point to amplify the brightness and also to get the similar extended image to get the information of the object's geometry. Lenses are round but the image is rectangle because the sensor is rectangle. That's why the vision of our single eye makes a circular image hence our combined view is oval  (combination of two circles)

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Everytime light rays intersect, (doesn't matter if that occurs at a screen/retina or not), they still do interact with each other by the phenomenon of wave-interference, we can't call it just interference as it is not a ray phenomenon but strictly a wave phenomenon. Also it is a down-right misconception that the waves need to be coherent and monochromatic. Light rays do intersect and always interfere, it is just the experimental conditions that may cause interference effects to not be measured.

          Interference will happen on the retina of the creature too, but that just makes fringes in the FOV and due to survival reasons, the brain must do something to cancel that effect. The vision system of the creature is detecting light from different angles in the FOV but has to do the temporal and spatial averaging, polarisation and wavelength/frequency averaging too. It is possible for an artificial light detector that can assist the eyes' evolutionary drawbacks. High refresh rate camera can detect interference, a microscope can make small width fringes to appear larger, use a frequency filter and one can see effects occurring at a very small frequency range, polarisation filters can differentiate different polarisation states.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">
          Now our creature has eyes that can see the things around, can see different colours, can resolve two objects apart to some level but what about the distance of the object. So that's why our creature needs two eyes so that using parallax, it can find out the relative distance of the objects in its view. And you are that creature too.</p>
