<div class = "container">

<h2>1. Introduction, Reality and Metaphysics</h2>
<blockquote>
    For my own part, I would rather excel in knowledge of the highest secrets of philosophy than in arms.
    <cite>— Alexander the Great</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>
Philosophy is the generalised study of any thing. Things are of two kinds: real things and abstract things. Real things are also termed as entities.
Entities are things that exists. To exist is to be the part of reality. Reality is the totality of entities and their descriptions.
</p>
<p>
The study of reality is called Metaphysics.
The goal of metaphysics is to find what things are entities and what are their descriptions.
Metaphysics is often regarded as the first philosophy.
</p>
<p>
Agents are entities that are able to experience reality and do reasoning.
You are an agent.
Objects are entities other than agents.
A chair is an object. 
</p>
<p>
Abstract things are not existent in reality as entities but still they can be conceived and described by agents.
For example, Spiderman, electric fields, point particles, line, etc.
</p>
<p>
Experience and reasoning are the processes through which an agent forms beliefs.
A belief is the attitude (judgement) held by an agent about any description of properties of a thing.
Properties are the things that describe other things.
</p>
<h2>2. Truth, Knowledge and Epistemology</h2>
<p>
A belief is qualified as true and be called a truth in two independent ways:<br>
1. If it corresponds to reality (the correspondence theory of truth) -
To correspond means that the belief actually describes an entity as it is.<br>
2. If it is reasoned coherently based on other truths or definitions (the coherence theory of truth) -
Reasoning is how an agent conceives any new belief (inferred beliefs) from already held beliefs.
</p>
<p>
Knowledge is truth that is justified (demonstrated or proven to be true).
Epistemology (theory of knowledge) is the study of justification of truths.
The goal of epistemology is to decide what beliefs are regarded as knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Epistemology is hence the branch of philosophy that focuses over what and how an agent can know about any thing either by experience (a posteriori) or by reasoning (a priori).
</p>
<p>
A posteriori knowledge - Beliefs that are justified to be true only by observation or empirical evidence.
</p>
<p>
A priori knowledge - Beliefs that are justified to be true without any need of observation or empirical evidence.
</p>  
<h2>3. Reason, Deductive Arguments and Logic</h2>
<p>
The initial beliefs from where reasoning starts are called premises and the inferred beliefs are called conclusions.
An argument is a set of premises that justifies a conclusion. Hence arguments are a formal usage of reasoning to establish a-priori knowledge.
</p>
<p>
An argument is called deductive if the conclusion is already included in the premises but may not be obvious to an agent.
Hence deductive argument "deduct" the required conclusion from the premises. They guarantee the truth of conclusion if the premises are true.
</p>
<p>
If the premises being true guarantees the conclusion also being true then the argument is called as a valid argument.
Moreover if the premises are true then such a valid argument is called a sound argument, otherwise it is called an unsound argument.
Invalid arguments do not guarantee the truth of conclusion hence are also called as fallacies.
</p>
<p>
The study of coherent reasoning is called Logic.
The goal of logic is to define the coherent rules of inference so that an agent can contruct arguments to prove or refute any belief.
Logic requires a formal system called logical language or syntax to express and organise beliefs.
A belief expressed in some formal language is called a proposition.
</p>
<h2>4. Analytic-Synthetic Distinction</h2>
<p>
<strong>4.1 Analytic</strong><br>
In a proposition, the subject is the description of a thing and the predicate is the description of properties of that thing. 
If there exists an x such that (all definitive properties are true for x), then x is labelled as whatever it is called.
They do not necessarily conform to reality but are true because the definitive properties must not contradict each other (coherent truth).
The predicate is hence the definition of the subject. So these propositions are true because of coherence.
They are a priori as they do not require empirical evidence. Examples:<br>
1. “A quadrilateral has four sides.” (Quadrilaterals are defined as planar shapes which have four sides.)<br>
2. “A sister is a female sibling.” (“Female siblings” and “sisters” are literally the same thing.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>4.2 Synthetic</strong><br>    
The predicate is not the definition of the subject, where properties other than definitive properties are claimed.
They are contingent either on reason or observation:
</p>    
<p><strong>4.2.1 A-posteriori Synthetic</strong><br>
Without using any sensory information or inferential experiment, the truth value of these claims cannot be decided.
Observation is sufficient to be true. Hence they are true by conforming to reality. Examples:<br>
1. “It is raining."<br>
2. “Water is H2O.”
</p>
<p>
Now consider "There is a hippopotamus in this matchbox."
I can try to observe but cannot find it, and then it can be argued that it is actually hidden maybe,
because not observing the hippo does not make the claim false.
But one can take the definition of a hippopotamus and a matchbox and analyze that it is bigger than a matchbox, so it cannot be in this matchbox.
So here, without observing a hippo, we can say that the claim is false.
In a way, we claimed that “A hippo cannot be in a matchbox” to be true, which is synthetic but not a posteriori.
</p>
<p><strong>4.2.2 A-priori Synthetic</strong><br>
No need for direct experience or observation to be true. Example: “For a triangle, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees.”
This is not the definition of a triangle but still is true without any direct observation.
However, it is impossible to prove the angle sum property of triangles without having the notion of space.
To define something, all sufficient properties must be met. After that, one can find necessary properties.
Reason is needed but also some sufficient background experience (conceptual) and definitions.
</p>
<p>
Consider “ought implies can.” It is not analytic and not a posteriori (though it can be verified), but to be true,
it requires reason alone starting from the definitions.
Ought to do something is a property of actions that are moral.
If someone cannot do an action, then the action is not there, hence cannot be judged for its morality.
</p>    
<p>
Now consider that all synthetic a priori claims are true in their conceptual framework, so the cases where the conceptual framework does not work,
the synthetic a priori claims do not work either.
For example, the angle sum property is true for triangles in Euclidean geometry only.
Hence, a priori synthetic claims are true only coherently.
</p>
<h2>5. Ampliative Arguments</h2>
<p>
An argument is called ampliative if the conclusions are not deduced from the premises but rather involve new beliefs.
They are such that one can deduce the premises from the conclusion if the conclusion is assumed to be true.
Ampliative arguments are useful in generating a-posteriori knowledge.
A non-deductive or ampliative argument is of two types:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inductive</strong> - Probable general conclusion from special observation.<br>
<strong>Abductive</strong> - Probable cause of conclusion from a general rule. 
</p>
<p>A table highlighting different types of arguments, given by Peirce.</p>
<div class="table-container">
<table>
<tr>
<td>Abduction</td>
<td>Deduction</td>
<td>Induction</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Case from Rule and Result</td>
<td>Result from Rule and Case</td>
<td>Rule from Case and Result</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rule (first principle): All the beans in this bag are white</td>
<td>Rule (first principle): All the beans in this bag are white</td>
<td>Case (hypothesis): These beans are from this bag</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Result (conclusion): These beans are white</td>
<td>Case (hypothesis): These beans are from this bag</td>
<td>Result (conclusion): These beans are white</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Case (hypothesis): These beans are from this bag. (The beans were taken out of this bag)</td>
<td>Result (conclusion): These beans are white. (These beans that we have now are white)</td>
<td>Rule (first principle) All the beans in this bag are white. (all the beans taken out will be white)</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<p>
Only deductive argument guarantees the truth of the conclusion.
Abductive and inductive arguments are trial fits to make the deduction work.
The idea of non-deductive arguments introduces the concept of probability.
</p>
<p>
In abduction, we seek a probable case that makes the conclusion deductively true given the rule is true.
</p>
<p>
In induction, we seek a probable rule that makes the conclusion deductively true given the case is true.
</p>
<p>
In a way, abduction is about finding what probably happened, and induction is about what probably will happen.
Deduction is finding what happens.
</p>

<h2>6. Münchhausen Trilemma</h2>
<p>
There are only three ways of completing an argument:<br>
<strong>The circular argument</strong>, in which the proof of some proposition presupposes the truth of that very proposition.<br>
<strong>The regressive argument</strong>, in which each proof requires a further proof, ad infinitum.<br>
<strong>The dogmatic argument</strong>, which rests on accepted precepts that are merely asserted rather than defended.
</p>
<p>
The trilemma, then, is the decision among the three equally unsatisfying options.
Karl Popper’s suggestion was to accept the trilemma as unsolvable and work with knowledge by way of conjecture and criticism.
</p>

<h2>7. Metaphysical Truths</h2>  
<p>
Synthetic a posteriori claims, as emphasized by Hume, are based on empirical observation and ampliative reasoning, which makes them contingent truths about the physical world. Since they depend on observation and could be otherwise, they are not truly metaphysical in the sense of being necessary truths about reality.
Instead, they describe the physical world rather than the metaphysical foundations of reality.
</p>
<p>
Synthetic a priori claims are also not metaphysical truths (opposed to what Kant argued) because their truth is contingent upon the conceptual framework (e.g., Euclidean geometry or classical mechanics) in which they operate.
They are coherent within these frameworks (models of reality or definitions of concepts) but not necessarily true of reality in an absolute metaphysical sense.
</p>
<p>
Metaphysical truths are hence the limit of synthetic a priori truths when they are immune to revision ("ultimate truths"),
as the definition on which synthetic a priori truths are contingent, is themselves contingent on how agents observe reality.
Metaphysical truths are necessary for experience to be possible, but to reach them one has to observe reality and revise the analytic truths.
So we can come up with metaphysical truths creatively and then only test their coherence.
This is why metaphysics is “analysis” of reality.
</p>

<h2>8. Science and Research</h2>
<p>
While finding metaphysical truths do tell us about reality but the process to find such truths turns out to be a process of trial and error.
This approach when formalised is called science.
Opposed to metaphysics, in science we do not seek the “ultimate truths” but rather we approximate reality for our uses.
If we find errors, we jump to a new, better approximation.
</p>
<p>
The goal of science is to create a description of the system (The part of reality you are interested in studying)
by establishing relations among the properties of the system by knowing all of its properties. At any instant such a description is called a theory.
The theory does not exactly describe the system but a model of the system which is an approximation of it.
Every observation of a system may give us knowledge of some properties of the system.
The model has to be developed such that it explains all the known properties.
But such a model is not complete; it has to predict new properties.
If such predictions are observed then such observations become evidence for the theory.
If observations are contrary to the predictions then the theory is revised or discarded. This process has to be repeated and be called as scientific research.
</p>
<h2>9. Axiology, Aesthetics and Ethics</h2>
<p>
But why an agent holds belief? One can say that because the agent may find such beliefs valuable.
Values are principles or standards that specify what is considered worthwhile or desirable. Axiology is study of values.
Broadly values are of two types: moral and non-moral.
</p>
<p>  
Ethics is the study of moral values and Aesthetics is the tudy of non-moral values.
Non-moral values are values that involve permissible actions.
Moral values are values that involve obligatory or forbidden actions.
</p>
<p>  
Moral agents are agents that can make choices based on what values they hold.
Ethics is the study of an agent’s choices.
In ethics, the goal is to find the right choices (what an agent is ought to do - moral principles).
Moral choices can only be made when the agent is able to make choice which Kant described as "Ought implies can."
But what implies ought?
Is it consequences or intentions?
